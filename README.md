# Sainsmart_4WD_Obstacle_Avoid_TestBed
This is a work in progress on developing methods for obstacle avoidance, wheel encoders, and other methodologies.  It is based on code from several sources which I will incorporate as I go.

Code based on example code from following:
```

More to follow as I add PID controls and Bubble rebound algorithm for obstacle avoidance
